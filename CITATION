       abstract = {We present the Unified Policy Framework (UPF), a
                   generic framework for modelling security
                   (access-control) policies. UPF emphasizes the view
                   that a policy is a policy decision function that
                   grants or denies access to resources, permissions,
                   etc. In other words, instead of modelling the
                   relations of permitted or prohibited requests
                   directly, we model the concrete function that
                   implements the policy decision point in a
                   system. In more detail, UPF is based on the
                   following four principles: 1) Functional
                   representation of policies, 2) No conflicts are
                   possible, 3) Three-valued decision type (allow,
                   deny, undefined), 4) Output type not containing the
                   decision only.},
